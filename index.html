He stood on the edge of the quayside, looking gloomily at the running waters that seemed to pass on without taking the slightest notice of the humanity all around. It was some kind of a holiday at the docks, and the usual hustle-bustle of maritime trade was absent. Only a few stray people walked about their business, apart from the ever-present seagulls.
A faint, cool wind with a slightly sharp edge to it blew along the quayside, causing Dorian to turn up his collar. He looked again at his watch: five minutes to noon. He still had that time to kill…the thought brought a cryptic smile to his lips.
Once again, he looked at the steadily greying sky, where the clouds were gathering in droves. Somewhere near the horizon, he could even spy a speck of lightning inching closer to the clouds. It would probably rain today, Dorian thought. 
At any rate, it would be a dramatic background for what was going to happen.
Three minutes left…Dorian wondered if she would be late…
“I seldom am.”
As if at his very thought, a voice floated from behind him. He turned to face an utterly stunning woman dressed in a royal-purple jumpsuit. Her flaming red hair was tied in a ponytail that waved about with the rhythm of the wind. Everything from her proud yet beautiful face, her deep dark eyes, and the wide smile on her lips exuded a touch of elegance.
Dorian smiled back at her, and they embraced.
“It’s been a long while, Moryna. I was beginning to think you’d forgotten about our meeting today.”
Moryna let out a laugh that strangely felt like a burst of frosty wind to Dorian and said, “C’mon, m’dear, you know I don’t forget. And it’s been what, just about…30 years 7 months, and 18 days since our last meeting, if I’m not wrong. And you know I never am.” 
Dorian sighed…he himself hadn’t kept count of the years that had passed since then. True, his hair now was as grey as the sky above, even though his face was still that of a man in his early thirties. Yet in his eyes, there lingered a terrible sadness, a feeling of something lost, never to be gained again.
“Let’s sit down somewhere, shall we?” Dorian proffered his hand to Moryna, who took it with a warmth that old lovers might exhibit. She guided him to a bench on the quayside, overlooking the river that still ran past everyone and everything, unshaken in its duty.
Moryna and Dorian sat there in silence for some time, looking at the darkening sky and the seagulls that floated about like spectral shadows against it. Then, as if to break the silence, Dorian spoke.
“So, this is it, right?” He started, and there was a hint of a smile in his sad eyes now. “It’s finally here, the day you and I leave this place for good.”
“Yep, I guess this is the big day, Dorian dearest.” Moryna chimed, her voice befittingly melodious. “Today, we let go of it all and leave for good. But tell me something, Dorian, why are you so eager for this?”
Dorian looked at the woman beside him and thought about what he should say. Suddenly, he found himself at a loss for words, his years of dreary existence catching up with him at last. As if in reply to her question, tears began to float down his cheeks.
“Oh, my…” Moryna lovingly leaned forward and wiped his tears away. She seemed a bit confused now, unsure of her next move. Finally, after a pause, she spoke soothingly.
“I understand, Dorian…it’s too painful. I guess that’s what it becomes like for everyone at some point. But why, though, I wonder? Even I can’t answer that. Why is the question…? Why do some want to, others don’t, yet others can’t? I still wonder…”
“Enough talk.” Dorian was suddenly sharp and businesslike. “We’ve wasted enough time; let’s begin.”
“Yeah yeah, sure. But let’s spend some time watching the storm, eh! I think this one’s going to be a great one.”
“Are you trying to avoid this somehow?” Dorian’s eyes narrowed in suspicion even as his voice became sharper. He looked at the woman before him, every bit as beautiful as before, but somehow he seemed to hate her suddenly. And weirdly enough, she understood perfectly.
“I wouldn’t have travelled all this distance to this god-forsaken riverside if I didn’t plan on going through with what was already settled over 30 years ago.” She started in a strong voice, suddenly imperious. Dorian shrank back a little, but again her tone changed to that of a loving friend.
“But before we do leave, why not spend a few moments more?” She chirped in her usual tone. “I must say, Dorian, you have chosen quite the setting for this…you are still a romantic at heart!”
“My heart shrivelled up and became dust a long, long time ago, Moryna. You, of all, should know this. You had a hand to play in it.” Dorian spoke quietly, sadly, as the words seemed to whisper from within him.
“A hand, yes, but not willingly. What happened was merely the course of my nature, dear. I can’t help it, just as you can’t help what you did with your life.”
“I never wanted any of this…I never wished for any of this to happen!” Dorian shouted suddenly, and the pain burst forth from his lips with the force with which he had kept it pent up within him all these years. He looked lost, a quiet, prematurely aged man trying eagerly to make sense of himself.
“And yet,” Moryna continued in her soft, soothing voice, “It did happen, every bit of it. You never wanted it, your family never wanted it, nobody did. And nothing you did made it happen, just as there was nothing you could have done to ensure it did not happen this way.”
“Am I just so…useless?” He asked her imploringly, and again she took his hands in her own. He felt a sense of kinship in her touch, a longing desire, a calming effect. She shook her head sadly and continued.
“Not useless, no. No one is useless; truly, we all have our uses. It’s just that you were meant to suffer thus. And mind you, the suffering was entirely of your own making. You could have escaped it, ignored it, just left it behind. But you choose to carry it with you. There’s nothing I or anyone could have done for that.”
“I do choose to carry it. It’s my burden to bear. I’ll never forget, and I’ll never forgive, even though I can’t really do anything about it.” Dorian replied.
“You can. You can let it all go.” 
“It’s not as easy as you make it out to be.”
“It’s actually even easier, Dorian. You just need to…let it all go. There’s nothing easier in the world. In any world. Yet, you have trouble with it. All of you do.”
They both sat again for some time in silence, watching the storm approach. By now, wispy droplets of rain were floating in the wind, hitting them with their ghostly touch. Dorian felt some of his pain taken away somehow, though he wasn’t sure if it would come back.
Around them, the quayside was quiet. The handful of people who were there before seemed to have vanished after Moryna had come. Only they were left on that solitary bench, looking ahead at the gathering clouds and thunder.
“You could have given me the kiss right then, you know, all those years back. I didn’t need to suffer so much, I have wasted away every moment, waiting for what if…” Dorian complained. 
“I’m afraid I could not have given it to you, Dorian, not then anyway. There’s a time and place for everything. I don’t decide it, I don't know who or what does. I just know what I have to do when the time comes. And as for your suffering, well, that you have brought upon yourself. Not through your actions, mind you. No matter what you would have done, the result would have been the same. The suffering, that was your choice.”
Another silence fell between them, perhaps the last and longest one. By then, the rain had started in earnest, and gusty winds blew all around. Dorian looked silently at the woman staring far into the horizon. She was so beautiful…yet there was a time when he had feared her, sought to avoid her, to defeat her even. Now he knew the folly of his youth was misplaced. Yet, there was something that still tugged at this heart and mind.
“What happens next?” He asked, breaking the silence between them, even as the storm settled over the other side of the river.
“Nothing, really. We ride into the storm.” They both stood up, hair billowing in the wind.
“One last question: was it all worth it? Worth the pain, the tears, and the heartbreak? Why couldn’t I have been spared it all? Others worse than me are still living happy lives…why does mine end this way?” Dorian screamed over the wind.
Moryna stood for a moment, looking away from him. Then when she looked into his eyes, he found his answers there all at once. It was all there, in the fire and the ice of her gaze, the flame and frost of her touch. He took her in his arms, and finally, after so many years of longing, she kissed him.
And as if at their touch, a vivid claw of lightning tore apart the sky. There was a clap of thunder, a flash of a thunderbolt, and both were gone forever, lost in the rain.
All that was left was the faint smell of lavender in the air.

                content: `Fitzpatrick tore his lucent gaze away from the dying sunlight and stared furtively at Mrs. Sally Enzo. The old gal seemed to be in a particularly chatty mood this evening.
“This carving over the fireplace is from the late sixteenth century. It was a personal favourite of my late husband, god rest his soul. He had a knack for the fineries of life; me personally, I don’t have the eye for antiques, if you get my drift.” She winked her left glass eye to emphasise her point.
Mrs. Maston took in every word with the inquisitive attention of the would-be buyer. Dressed in a dark gown which contrasted vividly with her pale skin and blonde hair, and one inch fingernails polished to a mirrory shine, the lean and severe woman looked the very antithesis of Mrs. Enzo, who was a short, plump old lady in a floral dress.
Fitzpatrick turned his attention once again to the outside visible through the open French windows of the living room. (The very nomenclature of the room, mingled with the nature of its present occupants, was quite the irony ). Evening had given way to night, and the clear sky had very few clouds. A moon as pallid as Mrs. Maston hung in one corner of the sky: a silver coin stuck with celestial glue against the inky backdrop. Maybe it was the sight of the full moon, or maybe it was because of the icy January wind that found its way into the room, a shiver went down Fitzpatrick’s back.
“The deal’s almost done,” he thought, “now the final tour, and only the paperwork would be left.”
Mrs. Enzo continued her elocution about the house.
“The architecture is predominantly Gothic, with touches  of Romanesque, Renaissance, Art Deco, and various other styles thrown in.”
“Why such an...eclectic form of architecture, may I ask?” Put in Mr. Maston. He was a thickset gentleman, shorter than his wife, dressed immaculately, with a heavily bearded face and small, reddish eyes that seemed to dart about everywhere.

“Ah!” exclaimed Mrs. Enzo, as if she were waiting for someone to ask this very question. “That has to do with the history of the house, which is pretty darn bloody, even if I do say so myself.”
Both the Mastons exchanged quiet glances with each other at this. Some vague, subconscious interest stirred inside them.
“Do tell.” Encouraged Mrs. Maston.
“Let’s all sit down.” Suggested Mr. Maston. There was an uncomfortable pause in the room, followed by the sound of shuffling chairs as everyone shifted their places of sitting towards the roaring fire. It was very cold after all. Mr. Maston took out a box of Sanguin cigarettes and offered them around.
“Don’t mind if I do,” proffered Mrs. Enzo, taking three from the box. Fitzpatrick refused politely, while Mrs. Maston did not deem it worthwhile to notice her husband’s gesture. She was too engrossed in examining the wood work of the mahogany settee she was occupying at the moment.
Fitzpatrick rubbed his hands nervously saying, “Well, Mrs. Enzo. Let’s have the history of this beautiful house.”
The old woman seemed to smell Fitzpatrick’s anxiousness and hence took her time finishing the cigarette. After she was satisfied that only the minutest portion of the stub was remaining, she tossed it into the fire and began.
“This place was originally a burial land belonging to the Quixon chief Horayz. Now this Horayz was a pretty interesting man. There are many legends about him-”
“Such as?” interjected Mrs. Maston.
“Such as he was in the habit of marrying a new girl every year, while he killed off the old wife. Or that he always ate the heart of the firstborn of every wife in the hope that it would enhance his longevity. Or perhaps that he was prone to burning anyone who dared oppose his cruel tax regime, and made the surviving family of the offender slaves. But one thing was certain that it was the Quixon custom to bury their war captives alive. And this was the land Horayz used for this purpose.”
There was a pregnant pause. Mrs. Enzo lit another cigarette. The Mastons exchanged another quick glance. Fitzpatrick gulped silently.
“After he had had his fill of death and blood,” Mrs. Enzo paused again, as if only to take notice of the stirring of something in the Mastons faces, and continued. “he retired and decided to build his winter resting palace on this land. He was of the opinion that by building his house over the graves of his victims, he would be able to hear their cries of agony as their pent up souls tried to force their way out of the ground.”
Mrs. Maston seemed to stiffen silently at the offhand way in which the old widow referred to the dead and buried. Mrs. Enzo continued.
“Then the house was occupied by the DeSauvilliers. The DeSauvilliers were a very wealthy family, and their business was one of the oldest in history: assassinations. Their method was to invite their victims over for dinner, then have them  for dinner.”
“You mean they we...were...cann...cannibals?” stammered Fitzpatrick, regretting the question the moment he had asked it.
“Maybe. I don’t know. Anyway, the DeSauvilliers were themselves murdered in this house one night by the Morgans, who then buried them(the DeSauvilliers) in the walls of the west wing.”
“And who were these Morgans?” asked Mr. Maston.
“Warlocks.” replied the widow.
A chill seemed to settle around the room as Mrs. Enzo continued the dark and bloody history of the house. Fitzpatrick once again glanced through the open windows at the dark and silent forest surrounding the lone mansion. As the night intensified, the forest was coming to life. The very trees seemed to be murmuring to each other. Suddenly, from the depths of the trees, a wolf howled. Another answered it, then another. Very soon the calls died down as suddenly as they had started. Fitzpatrick turned to see Mrs. Enzo smiling contently as she continued.
“They were Satanists and, of course, practised human sacrifices. Their family occupied the house for over a century, making various additions to it, and inspiring terror amongst the local villagers, till one night they all vanished into thin air as if by a spell. Got another of those Sanguins to spare?” she asked Mr. Maston, who silently handed her the cigarette box.
After one or two long drags, Mrs. Enzo began again.
“The house remained abandoned for a long time till it was finally bought by Dr. Dornut. His line of study was not quite conventional, so he needed a secluded place for setting up his laboratory. You can still find remnants of it in the Underwing. He lived in this house for some years, continuing his experiments, but when children began to disappear from the local village, the villagers attacked the house and drove him away. It was from The Mad Doctor that my husband bought the place. Theodore was always fond of large houses."
Mrs. Enzo paused to steal a fond glance at the yellowing skull on the mantelpiece. Theodore Enzo grinned back grotesquely at his loving wife. With a sigh reminiscent of good times long past, the old woman took up the thread of conversation again.
"I prefer the open woods myself. Houses make me feel, well, coffined.” The old woman smiled meaningfully at the Mastons, who maintained a poker face. Fitzpatrick was growing nervous by the minute and was literally on the edge of his seat. The only thing he wanted now was the deal to be signed and done with.
“Is the house haunted?” Mrs. Maston asked suddenly. Mrs. Enzo gave a cackling laugh.
“If it is, the ghosts have avoided me quite well. Maybe you will have better luck.” She winked pointedly at Fitzpatrick, who was having a lot of trouble holding himself together. Deciding not to give either party more room to manoeuvre, he decided to close things.
“Erm..eh...most illuminating Mrs. Enzo, most illuminating.” He laid out the necessary paperwork on the small coffee-table in front and took out a pen.
“If all is said and done, let’s finish the formalities?” He pushed the papers forward nudgingly.  After a few seconds of unnecessary tension, the Mastons and Mrs. Enzo took up their respective copies, went through the papers carefully, and finally, to the relief of Fitzpatrick, completed the signatures. Then a few meaningless pleasantries were exchanged, the date of possession was decided upon, and the Mastons took their leave.
“Well, good riddance,” growled Mrs. Enzo after the Mastons were gone, though whether she was referring to the buyers or the house itself Fitzpatrick could not tell.
“Thanks for helping me close the deal, Fitz. Now, the Moon is at its height, and I must change for the night. Goodbye. You can let yourself out.”
The night was colder now, and a wispy mist lay all over. Fitzpatrick looked back up from the driveway at the dark and lonely house, standing in the middle of this forest, and thought of its bloody history. A faint wind rustled through the trees, breaking the mist, and passing through Fitzpatrick, whose form was slowly beginning to lose its quota of ectoplasm. He heaved a sigh of relief.

“Three and a half centuries as a real-estate agent,” he muttered to himself as he floated away towards Hampington Village, “never have I ever had to face such a treacherous deal. The old werewolf lady is pain enough as it is, but to broker a deal between her and that vampire couple...oh god! I gotta rest for some days...otherwise...”
He droned on and on as the mists slowly engulfed his now ethereal form. The night was silent once more.
From somewhere, a wolf howled.

                content: `From a luxurious-looking chocolate brown car emerged a man well-covered. He was wearing a black hat that came down almost to his brows; a pair of dark shades hid his eyes from others, and a large beard, almost as black as his hat, obscuring the rest of his face, blended perfectly with the overcoat he was wearing.
The man gave some instructions to his driver, who drove off as his master had told him to. The hatted man then emerged onto the main street and began to walk amongst the crowd, taking in his surroundings. 
It was a cold night, and a digital clock in a shop window showed that it was almost half past seven. But still, there were a considerable number of people walking about on the street. 
The man surveyed all those walking around, towards and past him with a crooked and malevolent satisfaction. He was amused, amused because no one could recognize him. A little addition to his face and attire, and he had been transformed from the celebrity that he was to a non-entity. 
He wondered and laughed in his mind: should he remove the hat and beard, a small mob would form around him, all fools, struggling and begging for an autograph, or a selfie, or even a quick glance...
Suddenly the man found his thoughts blocked by a young girl who was in his way. The girl was in her twenties, neither too short nor too tall, with a kind, adorable face and lush golden hair. She was wearing glasses and was looking at him with a curiously hungry expression. 
All of a sudden, the girl took out a phone and clicked a picture of the man.
“Hey, what’s this?” the man protested.
In return, the girl looked at him with an awed gaze. The man repeated his query.
“What’s this? Who the hell are you?”
“I’m...I’m...” the girl stammered. “Aren’t you Andrew Roberts, the famous movie star?”
Andrew was clearly surprised, for he had thought that no one would be able to recognize him in this attire. So he asked again:
“Who says so?”
“Oh, I know you are!!” the girl said excitedly, almost jumping up and down. “The number of times I’ve seen you on screen...I almost remember your every move in every movie.”
For a second, Andrew thought that he would deny his being himself. But then, looking at the girl, he could not bring himself to lie so blatantly to this pretty young thing. 
Also, somehow the girl appeared vaguely familiar to Andrew. But he just could not remember exactly where he had seen her before.  But since he'd been with many women in his time, he just put the feeling away as a slip of thought. 
“Well, you’ve got me." He replied with his trademark smile. "I am Roberts. But you still haven’t answered me, who’re you?”
“I...my...I’m Katrina Kuffing.” The girl stammered, apparently still in awe of her hero.
“I gather you are a fan of my movies,” Andrew said in his deep voice.
Katrina beamed in agreement. 
“A very big fan, Mr. Roberts; you’re sort of etched on my mind.”
This time it was Andrew who smiled. Even at fifty, he was still etched on his female fans’ minds. He returned from his musings and looked at the girl; she was still ogling at him.
Considering something in his mind, Andrew suddenly said:
“As you are a very big fan of mine and seem to know a lot about me, I guess I should get to know something about you too. How about going for coffee?”
“That would be a dream come true, Mr. Andrew.” The girl replied, as if in a daze, still not able to believe her luck.
So they walked to a café together. As it was cold, the place was full of people merrily chatting over steaming cups, and Andrew had to pass some money to a nearby waiter to get a table. As the café was already packed to capacity, no one noticed the bearded man and the girl with the golden hair. Andrew ordered two espressos.
“Thank you, sir,” Katrina said after the drinks had been served.
“Call me Andrew, and I’ll call you Kats,” Andrew said with a smile, the smile that had won so many hearts. 
“Thanks. I was waiting for this, Andrew.” Kats smiled a lovely one. 
“So Kats,” said Andrew. “What’s your job, apart from seeing my movies?”
“My work involves shooting stars.”
Andrew suddenly felt a bit odd because as Katrina said this, he thought he had seen a sudden spark of mirth flare up in her eyes for a fraction of a moment and then die again. The very next second, as Andrew looked into her beautifully shaped hazel eyes, he rebuked himself for thinking such idiotic things.
“Shooting stars, eh? Oh! I get it; you’re associated with some space agency, right?”
Katrina once more smiled one of her charming smiles. 
“No, no,” she replied. “I didn’t mean meteors or such stuff. I’m a photographer for a film magazine, and I have to take shots of movie stars. I’m fairly new to the job.” 
“Really? So I guess it must mean a lot to you, this interview of mine.”
“Interview?” Katrina looked puzzled. 
Andrew put down his coffee cup and looked at her with a serious face.
“Look, Kats,” he said. “Photography...it’s nice for starting out. But if you want to rise in the media profession, then you have to move on to bigger and better things. And let me tell you, I can get you some good photo sessions with some of the biggest stars in the movie business. You can also take their interviews, and I know for a fact that commoners adore reading about their favourite celebrities. It’s almost like an addiction for them.”
“So what you’re saying is that you’ll give me an interview with you?”
“Why not? In fact, we can go to my flat nearby and have dinner. It’s not very late. Come on.”
“Ooooh! You’re so kind, Andrew. It’s almost as if I am...I really have nothing to say!”
“You know Kats, you are very silly,” Andrew said jocosely.
“The best compliment for me.”
Andrew paid the bill, and together with Katrina, he walked out of the café towards his nearby flat, which was one of many he had all over the town. 
Even though it was only a quarter past eight, the streets were considerably empty. The stores were slowly closing down, and a chill draft was wafting about. Soon the two reached Andrew’s flat.
“Your house is so very beautiful, Andrew,” Katrina said as she sank onto the sofa in the living room. By this time, Andrew had taken off his disguise, revealing a handsome face even at his age and his golden shock of hair. 
Suddenly Katrina said something to herself.
“Did you just say something, Kats?” Andrew asked, sitting next to her.
“I was just thinking...how rumours should not be believed. Just look at you; you are so nice, and people go about saying a lot of nasty things about you.”
“What kind of nasty things?”
“Oh, the worst!” Katrina said hotly. “People say that you are very arrogant and selfish, that you’ve destroyed many people’s careers to make your own. Also, they say that you left your wife and little daughter for your own gains.”
Andrew looked suddenly away from Katrina. His face slowly grew dark and serious as his memories churned back to the days when he had been only a struggling artist. 
He had loved Samantha. She was a rising star in those days, and so marrying her had proved quite profitable for Andrew’s own career.
But then, as her fortunes began to fall, Andrew started to rise. But he had no regrets about leaving Samantha, the child...he'd turned her out before the thing was even born.
“You should not believe all that you hear,” Andrew said seriously as he came out of the shadow of his past.
“Of course, I don’t believe any of it. Now, let me take a good picture of you.”
“O.K.” Saying so, Andrew stepped back a little and struck a pose. Katrina stood up.
“You really like posing for pictures, don’t you? Well, I’m going to make a good picture of you.”
“Are you going to shoot me with your phone?”
Katrina laughed a cold, high laugh and drew out a revolver from her bag.
“I don’t need a camera to shoot you, Father.”
